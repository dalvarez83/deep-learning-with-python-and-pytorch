# deep-learning-with-python-and-pytorch
Course material on developing Deep Learning models using PyTorch. The materials shows how to build and train deep neural networksâ€”learning how to apply methods such as dropout, initialization, different types of optimizers and batch normalization. The course then focuses on Convolutional Neural Networks, training your model on a GPU and Transfer Learning (pre-trained models). The course ends with a focus on dimensionality reduction and autoencoders. Including principal component analysis, data whitening, shallow autoencoders, deep autoencoders, transfer learning with autoencoders, and autoencoder applications. This course was created by IBM.
